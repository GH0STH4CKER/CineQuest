"Design a modern, visually stunning, and mobile-friendly UI for a Movie/TV-Series Finder website. The website should include:

A prominent search bar at the top for users to search movies or TV series.

Search results displayed as stylish cards showing: title, year, type (movie/series), and poster.

Clicking on a card opens a detailed view with: genre, director, actors, plot, IMDB rating, and poster.

Clean, modern design with smooth animations, consistent spacing, and a visually appealing color palette.

Fully responsive layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile.

Dynamic data fetching from my API using the OMDb API with base URL http://www.omdbapi.com/ and API key [api_key].

Include hover effects for cards, easy-to-read typography, and a subtle modern background.

Focus on usability, fast navigation, and aesthetic appeal.

Generate the complete front-end UI design mockup including interactive elements, card layouts, and detail view, suitable for implementation in React or vanilla HTML/CSS/JS."
